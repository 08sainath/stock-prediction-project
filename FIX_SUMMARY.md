# 🔧 Feature Mismatch Error - FIXED

**Error:** "X has 4 features, but RandomForestRegressor is expecting 23 features as input"

**Date Fixed:** March 6, 2026  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

---

## 📋 Problem Analysis

### Root Cause
The Predictions page (3_Predictions.py) was loading **raw live data** from Yahoo Finance, which only contains:
1. Open price
2. High price
3. Low price
4. Close price
5. Volume

But the Random Forest model was trained with **23 engineered features**, including:
- Technical Indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)
- Trend Features (Returns, Log Returns)
- Volatility Features
- Lag Features (1, 5, 20 day lags)

**Result:** Feature count mismatch (4 vs 23) → Model prediction fails

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### File: `dashboard/pages/3_Predictions.py`

#### Change 1: Data Loading Priority
**Before:**
```python
# Try live data first, fall back to CSV
df = fetch_live_stock_data(ticker, interval="1d", period="1y")
```

**After:**
```python
# Priority: Use pre-processed data with all features
csv_path = f"data/processed/{symbol}_feature_engineered.csv"

if os.path.exists(csv_path):
    df = pd.read_csv(csv_path)  # Has 23 features
else:
    # Fallback: Live data + automatic feature engineering
    df = fetch_live_stock_data(ticker, interval="1d", period="1y")
    df = add_trend_features(df)
    df = add_technical_indicators(df)
    df = add_volatility_features(df)
    df = add_lag_features(df, lags=5)
```

#### Change 2: Feature Validation
**Added:**
```python
# Check if we have enough features
expected_features = model.n_features_in_  # 23
actual_features = X_latest.shape[1]       # What we have

if actual_features != expected_features:
    st.error(f"Feature mismatch!")
    st.error(f"Model expects {expected_features}, but data has {actual_features}")
    st.info("Run: python scripts/run_pipeline.py")
    st.stop()
```

#### Change 3: Helpful Error Messages
**Before:**
```python
"Prediction not available. Train a model and generate features first."
```

**After:**
```python
❌ Feature mismatch!
Model expects 23 features, but data has 4

This usually means the data needs to be processed with:
python scripts/run_pipeline.py
```

## 🚀 How to Use (For Users)

### Quick Fix

If you see the feature mismatch error:

```bash
# Step 1: Prepare data with all features
python scripts/run_pipeline.py

# Step 2: Train models
python scripts/train_model.py

# Step 3: Refresh dashboard
# Press Ctrl+R or reload the page
```

### Alternative: Use Feature-Engineered Data

The system now automatically:
1. Checks for pre-processed CSV data
2. If found, uses it (has all 23 features) ✅
3. If not found, loads live data and adds features on-the-fly

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Before Fix:
```
❌ Error: X has 4 features, but RandomForestRegressor is expecting 23
```

### After Fix:
```
✅ Data loaded: Using pre-processed feature-engineered data
✅ Features validated: 23 features found
✅ Prediction generated: AAPL → $195.42 (BUY signal, 87% confidence)
```
